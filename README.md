# Jonathan Raphael
Partner and Technology Director at Biso, passionate about learning and always on the lookout for cutting-edge technologies that can transform the world. With a solid knowledge base in Software Engineering, including Software Architecture, Design Patterns, Functional and Object-Oriented Programming, I am always looking for ways to apply this knowledge to create innovative solutions.

My journey in the technology field began when I was a teenager, and since then I have not stopped being amazed and learning from the endless possibilities that technology can offer. During this period of discovery, I admit that many cellphone and computer systems from that time were compromised (you learn from your mistakes, right? lol), but it was from this experience that my passion for Software Engineering flourished and became a bigger goal.

Today, at Biso, I have the opportunity to use technology to uncover valuable information and transform data into intelligent solutions for companies that sell online.

There is nothing that excites me more than a good conversation about innovation and technology, so if you want to exchange ideas, just call me for a ‚òïÔ∏è. Let's transform the world together with technology! üöÄ
